          <h2>SeaLion Milk Cheese</h2>
          <br>
          <p> 
              <span>Sea Lion milk cheese was originally made by an African tribe in Tanzania and later developed and produced by the British colonists. It is known for being one of the most expensive cheeses in the world.</span>
              <br><br>
              <span>The Sea Lion is made from milk, but it is unlike any other cheese you may have tasted. It is not soft, and it is not hard. The cheese is actually a hard cheese with a cream and sea lion inside.</span>
              <br><br>
              <span>It is an unusual cheese that is still a popular favourite among cheese lovers. It is a very expensive cheese, with a single wheel of Sea Lion cheese costing around $1,500.</span>
              <br><br>
              <span>The Sea Lion cheese is not made from the same animal as most other cheeses.</span>
              <br><br>
              <span>It is not made from curds, but rather from whey. It is an emulsion, a cross between whey and milk. It is creamy and has a salty, almost fishy taste. It is served on crackers, and it is used to make soups.</span>

          <h2>Breded Cheese</h2>
          <br>
          <p>
            <span>Breded cheese is a cream cheese spread made from cow's milk, not from goat's milk. </span>
            <br><br>
            <span>Breded cheeses should have shorter shelf lives because fats that are more unctuous evaporate faster. One brand references Norm Berry Mix, Angelton Butter closed cepts and Royal cheese cracked dry with yeast.</span>
